# Changes Made to AI Service Integration

## Firebase Functions

We've implemented two Firebase Functions for the DeepSeek API integration:

1. **getAIResponse** - A non-streaming API call that returns a full response at once.
2. **streamAIResponse** - A simulated streaming response that returns chunked text for a more interactive experience.

### Security Improvements

- Moved the DeepSeek API key to Firebase Functions Config (secure environment variables)
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Fixed code that could expose API keys in logs

### Configuration

The DeepSeek API key is now stored in Firebase config:

```bash
firebase functions:config:set deepseek.api_key="your_key_here"
```

### Testing

A test script has been added to verify the DeepSeek API integration works correctly before deploying.

```bash
npm run test:api
```

## Flutter App Integration

The `AIService` class in `lib/services/ai_service.dart` has been updated to:

1. Fix method naming conflicts (renamed duplicate `streamAIResponse` method to `_legacyStreamAIResponse`) 
2. Improve API key handling to prevent exposure in logs
3. Update method parameters to properly pass StreamController instances
4. Better handle errors and provide fallback responses

### Usage in the App

No changes are needed to how the app calls the AI service. The existing methods maintained their signatures:

```dart
// Non-streaming
Future<String> getAIResponse(List<Map<String, dynamic>> messages)

// Streaming 
Stream<String> streamAIResponse(List<Map<String, dynamic>> messages)
```

## Deployment Instructions

1. Navigate to the `functions` directory
2. Run the deployment script: `bash deploy.sh`
3. The script will:
   - Install dependencies
   - Check for the DeepSeek API key and prompt to set it if missing
   - Deploy the functions to Firebase

## Next Steps

To fully switch from the temporary implementation to the Firebase Functions:

1. Deploy the Firebase Functions
2. Ensure they are working correctly using the test script
3. Remove the fallback/temporary code in `AIService` once the Firebase Functions are stable

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Firebase Functions logs: `firebase functions:log`
2. Verify the DeepSeek API key is correctly set
3. Test the API directly using the test script
4. Check network connectivity and CORS settings
